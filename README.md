# Healthcare Dataset Analysis
## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of a healthcare dataset, covering exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical insights, and predictive modeling. The goal is to uncover patterns in patient demographics, medical conditions, billing, and hospital operations, and to predict patient test results based on their medical profiles.
Features. You can find the dataset by cliking [here.](datasets\healthcare_dataset.csv)

* Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares raw healthcare data for analysis.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes distributions of age, gender, medical conditions, and more.
* Statistical Analysis: Performs hypothesis testing and correlation studies.
* Predictive Modeling: Uses machine learning to predict patient test results.
* Time Series Analysis: Examines seasonal trends in hospital admissions.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following key fields:
* Patient demographics (age, gender)
* Medical information (blood type, medical condition, medication)
* Hospital details (doctor, hospital, admission type)
* Financial data (billing amount, insurance provider)
* Test results (normal/abnormal)

## Requirements
`pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, scikit-learn, statsmodels`
